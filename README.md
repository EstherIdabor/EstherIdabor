### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, ### I am Esther from Nigeria.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...she/her
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m building my skills in frontend development and currently learning javascript and react.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
I believe one way to make an impact and create the future we want is through contributions to open source projects that are inclusive of everyone.
I am pasionate about technical writing and currently honing my skill in technical writing. Technical writing affords every developer the opportunity to be expressive.
